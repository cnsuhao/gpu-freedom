Programming languages
---------------------
core, mainapp and screensaver in Freepascal/Lazarus
server in PHP&mySQL
plugins and frontends in Freepascal/C/C++/Java and executables targeting the platform on which GPU II runs

Targeted platform
-----------------
client GUI will run on Windows, Linux and MacOSX (everywhere where Lazarus runs)
client core will run on Windows, Linux and MacOSX (everywhere where freepascal runs), if the processor has multiple cores, the user can choose to run multiple cores in parallel
 it will also feature an interative console similar to Mutella
server will run on Windows, Linux, MacOSX, several Unix flavors (everywhere where PHP/mySQL run on Apache)
