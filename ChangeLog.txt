			 revised status for tbjobqueue
			 better core shoutdown, waiting for services to finish
			 implementeted dbcompthreadmanager to handle db aware computation services

Core Client: managed to recompile core, managed to retrieve clients from server and store it in sqlite, however, still deadlocks presumably with sqlite (need to check lockfiles though)
		added OctaveGUI as external library, Octave could be used as external Computer Algebra System. Maybe we could bind Maxima in a similar way, too.

1.3.2013 0.5.7

File Distributor Server: search among computers is possible under
http://www.gpu-grid.net/file_distributor/list_computers.php

03-04.08 Deltasql development. It is used now in production at Logobject AG
 see also http://deltasql.sourceforge.net

22.03.08 0.953 release notes
- removed blinking arrow at startup as it might create some race conditions
 on old computers
- log rotation bugfix, caused GPUs to crash and never restart after several months
 of running
- eternity2 milestone bugfix
- scriptparser plugin by Thexa understands LUA scripts
- several unfinished works: nanobit frontend for distributed stored procedures,
 dangermouse frontend for sensor networks 
- more work is still needed at TGnutella layer to definitively get rid of duplicates

05.03.08 0.9256
Thexa4 releases scriptparser.dll, a script parser for LUA scripts

01.03.08 CVS
- nanobit's frontend for distributed stored procedures (WAN database
 browser) has a hierarchical view on variables
- Thexa commits some fixes on scriptparser
- initial release for the interface Pico Datalogger - GPU
- 23:44 evviva :-) data sent from sensor to GPU is relayed back locally
 to the sensor frontend and displayed graphically. Needs more refinement though

29.02.08 0.9255
- log rotation bugfix (critical): GPUs running for months are creating 1000
logfiles. If more than 100 logfiles, than GPU was hanging in the background
before the form showed up. Happens after 3-4 months of running.
- initial release for the Sensor Network Frontend (skeleton)

25.02.08 0.9254
3D Network Mapper:
- refresh button disables it after pressed once, and reenables it.
- messages which do not contain the XML flatfile tag are discarded.

25.02.08 0.9253 CVS
- Thexa commits scriptparser plugin 
- GPU core contains layer to relay sensor packets (the sensors broadcast service)
- Parameters in Gnutella.pas changed from
 MAX_QUEUE     = 13;
 MAX_HASH      = 17;
to
 MAX_QUEUE     = 1330;
 MAX_HASH      = 171;

This causes much more memory footprint of GPU core, but should prevent the
avalanche effect which can be sometimes observed on GPU as bursts in network traffic:
 what happens is that if there are too many nodes, the circular lists that detect
  double packets get overflowed and do not work anymore, therefore their limiting
   effect on network traffic is nullified.
 

22.02.08 CVS
- nanobit commits Wide Area Network Database browser
(see also his wiki page at http://www.gpu-grid.net/wiki/index.php/PWanDB )
The concept is revolutionary and can be imagined as "distributed stored procedures"

20.09.07 Network

In June, a lightning hit one of the entry nodes (spartacus). Damages included the windows partition configuration files and the water cooling pump. After that until mid September, only Laurent's lwm-media node was available as entry node, the GPU network never was so close to shutdown. In September, Ninja (Stefano Godenzi) tried to revive spartacus, but also the processor turned out to be burned. Ninja then upgraded the guevara node (an AMD Athlon 700 MHz) with low-noise fans and recovered DVD and 1Gig-Ethernet card from spartacus. An attempt to install Windows Vista failed due to the much more restrictive Genuine program. Therefore guevara is now running Debian 4.0 with wine and will act as entry node for GPU in the future. 


12.9.07 0.9477
- Eternity: storing of several log files under plugins\output including
 current best depth and overall best depth. Solving of hints puzzles
  6x6 and 12x6 in 1 respectively 20 seconds. Result from plugin is

13.7.07 done a bugfix for race condition at startup. Should be okay now...

12.7.07 0.947 still not released as there are race conditions on
 <andromeda> (old laptop). On new Intel Core Duo <gandhi> everything ok,
  a little bit strange though. Problem seems to be search_plugin.dll

11.7.07 Release Notes 0.947
- screensaver with password protection
- updater should be Vista compatible as it asks user to close GPU core first
- File Distributor server handles team statistics correctly

- orsa: bugfixes to orsa_orbit, and to orsa_integrator_ra15

20.06.07 lighting shuts down <spartacus>

Wednesday evening <spartacus> was shutdown because of strong lightnings.
However, during shutdown "install windows updates" was chosen, lightning
 hit some configuration files under c:\windows\config. Windows partition
  not bootable anymore. Therefore, Debian 4.0 installed with wine.

After one hour of operation heard overheating beeps. Stopped system
and discovered that water cooling pump had failed as well. Close to processor
 one water cooling tube was fused on the top.
 
Will take a while until <spartacus> is repaired. Ask Ninja for help.
In the meanwhile, strong support of <lwm-x64>. <guevara> seems also to keep running
 well.


12.6.07 0.9462
- version reporting on FD server

8.6.07 CVS (after midnight)
- now liborsa works, velocities are equal to JPL, but I had to compute mu
 out of sqrt((4 Pi^2 a^3)/mu)=365.25 which is the turnaround period in days.

1.4.07 Extensions tracker
Update to Terragen 2 Analysis results:
Data on http://www.gpu-grid.net/gpu/exp/tg2/tg2-firstlight.zip

It was possible to generate a picture with a planet by following the tutorial (probably no way to add Saturn rings).

The format of the project file changed from .tgw which was not human readable, to a non standard XML .tgd which is human readable. TG2 Technology Preview is more straightforward in usage as TG 0.9.x

Currently, the tgdcli.exe, which is the command line interface to Terragen is broken and does not accept parameters.
The command line interface was fixed, but the fix is available only to registered users.

Terrain file is now specified in .tgd. Probably no flag to give it on the command line. Terrain files of 0.9.x are
combatible with TG2. They probably are exactly the same.

If .tgs files generated by Terranim with camera path should not be supported by the command line tgdcli.exe, then no problem: one could easily parse .tgs and fill into the .tgd camera position and view angles.

If command line will be fixed for the free non commercial version, it will take about one weekend of work, to make GPU earthsim plugin Terragen 2 compliant. 	

All files in /sandbox will be moved in /sandbox/terragen-0.9 and a new directory /sandbox/terragen will be created.

A tutorial to add planets and moons in Terragen 2 is here:
http://www.designpaths.com/terragen-tutorials/adding-planets/ 	
Terragen 2 is available at:
http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/download.php?item=tg2freewin

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPU is yet another Gnutella client. In addition to the standard functionality for sharing files, GPU is able to share CPU-time among users. GPU will provide a robust framework for distributed computing, but unlike Kaazaa, GPU won't hurt the basic principle of Gnutella: "every node is able to use services from other nodes and has to offer services to other nodes". This means that the computational tasks will be fully transparent to the users, and all users will have the privilege of starting a computation.

GPU implements the commands for the computation in an elegant way, making easy to extend the set of basic computing functions the Gnutella-node knows. GPU doesn't suffer of the limits a virtual machine has: plugins are developed as dynamic link libraries which are loaded at runtime and allow computations to be performed at the maximum speed, the speed of machine-compiled code. Of course, if GPU developes, there will be the necessity of signing these plugins, to avoid serious security holes.

Possible applications are the search for prime numbers and golomb rulers, montecarlo integrations, stochastic solving of PDEs, number factorisation, cryptographic applications and repetitive tasks over huge chunks of data, e.g. a Fast Fourier Transform over data recorded from telescopes, to find out special events in the Universe. 

At the moment, a working prototype exists, written in Delphi for Windows. 


small add: GPU is also the first client that tries to implement a chat system directly over the Gnutella transport protocol. Of course we don't know if the system will work or not, but let's try.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prototype description:


GPU is a prototype for an application which shares CPU-time of normal computers connected to the Internet.
To do this, the application connects to the Gnutella network and, as any other Gnutella client does, is able to share files with others. In addition the application, from now on simply called the node, is able to send, receive and perform some computational jobs.
Jobs travel through the Gnutella network disguised as search string for files, until they find a node willing to execute them or until their short life terminates, limited by a counter decreased every time the job is retransmitted again.
Once the good-willing node finishes the job, it returns the result to sender. The sender has to collect results the same way he does for files found on the network.
Jobs are described with the polnish notation, which can be interpreted as commands for a stack. "1 + 1" becomes "1,1,+" and although at first look it seems more complicated, it frees the node from some difficult issues, like operator precedence and bracket management.
The application implements the commands for the computation in an elegant way, making easy to extend the set of basic computing functions the node knows.

At the moment the following plugins exist and work:


- a simple plugin that computes Pi using the method of throwing randomly a point and checking if it is in the circle with radius one. This is one of the easiest montecarlo computations, easy to understand for people willing to implement their first plugin

- a plugin with simple operations on vectors, like dot and cross product.

- a complex plugin for computing the discrete logarithm over huge integers, the inverse function of the most used one-way function in cryptography (although cryptographers won't fear this plugin, even if all computers on Internet will run the plugin! It takes an hour for solving the discrete log problem on one machine with a 42 bit integer, cryptographers use 2048 bit numbers!).

GPU was tested in different network topologies (trees and graphs), but the number of workstations involved never exceeded 10.

We search for people interested in the project: if you want to partecipate, you are welcome!
